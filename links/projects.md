bot  >> Yes. Yes.
user >> What do you think on Joe Biden?
bot  >> He wants to raise your taxes. He wants to increase regulations. He doesn’t want to cut social security or Medicare. He does not want to close down your factories. He will destroy your police departments. You know what they call them. They don’re called police departments right now. They say, “We’ll never let you do that.” No, he would abolish police departments, but he has no clue.
user >> What do you think on mexicans?
bot  >> They like mexican. That means they like me. It’d be nice if they were allowed to vote.
